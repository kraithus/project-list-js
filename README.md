# project-list-js
what does a unemployed weebo shutin do

## Installation

### For Plebs
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html`.

### For Dukes
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place it wherever your server is (I don't know why you're doing this).
3. Access it at `localhost/your-folder-name/data_entry.php`.

## Usage

Now, it's quirky... There are Region, Council, Category... and, and uh... oh! Project Name.

1. When you submit, Region and Council are retained, dropdown is disabled, and category select switches to the next item on the list because each council has just 1 project in each category.
2. Click the session clear button (forgot what I named it... ah, clear session).

When you add, it goes to... adds an object (I believe it's called) to the `projects_list.txt` file. How I ended up with `projects_list_formatted.json` is another Python script I won't tackle; you can ask Chad GPT.

## DataTable

I don't know how the script parses stuff; I just asked Chad GPT. There are no borders; it looks kinda horrible, but it gets the job done. Now... data is loaded from the `projects_list_formatted.json`.

The rest is CDN stuffâ€”I mean, look guys, I'm tired. If you read this far, buy me an Afrimax bundle.

If you're just a pleb, you can nuke everything else except `ico.png`, `index.html`, and `projects_list_formatted.json`. If anything crashes, I apologize; I didn't know what I was saying.
